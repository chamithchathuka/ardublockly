# Ardublockly package
The package folder contains the Python scripts required to package Ardublockly into a standalone executable. This way it can be distributed without any dependencies other than having the Arduino IDE.

Currently the Windows build is created using py2exe and the Linux and Mac OS X builds are created using PyInstaller (in the future PyInstaller might be updated to also create the Windows builds, for now the original py2exe script is pretty stable). 


## Download the packaged Ardublockly
The stable binaries for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are hosted in GitHub as part of the [repository releases][1].

Development builds are frequently triggered in build servers and hosted in the following link: [Dev builds][10]

## Ardublockly source code dependencies

### Git
Git needs to be installed on the system and accessible through the command line interface.


### Python 
These build scripts only work on Python 2.7.

While the non-GUI version of Ardublockly (command line server + pre-installed browser) is compatible with other Python versions (tested on Python 2.7 and 3.4), due to the individual perks of the python libraries used here and unavailability of CEF Python 3 bindings, a single build environment based on Python 2.7 will be targeted.

If you are using Python virtual environments on Windows this [collection of Python extensions binaries][2] is highly recommended.

The specific versions of the Python dependencies can be found in the [requirements.txt][3] file.

#### cefpython3
CEF Python provides Python bindings for the Chromium Embedded Framework. This is used in Ardublockly to create a webview of the Ardublockly web app without requiring any specific browser installation. This is specially useful for the project because the frameworks used work best on the Chrome engine.

[Install cefpython following their project installation instructions][5]. On Windows and Mac OS X cefpython can be easily installed using pip:

```
pip install cefpython3
```

#### wxPython
wxPython provides python bindings for the wxWidgets, the cross-platform GUI toolkit.

You can download wxPython from their [official website][4].

(I have recently found some odd issues in Ubuntu 15.04 when cefpython is running with wxPython version 3.0.2.0, reverting back to the 2.8.12.1 version seemed to fix them.)

#### py2exe
py2exe is a Distutils extension to build Python scripts into Windows executable programs. 

This package is only required for the Windows build. The Linux and Mac OS X builds use the PyInstaller scripts included in this folder.

You can download py2exe from their [official website][6].

#### PyInstaller
Converts (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, used for the Linux and Mac OS X builds.

This package does not need to be installed, as it is already included in this folder.

This version of PyInstaller is from the official [repository wiki][9]. As the version stored in Pypi is quite old, pip would install an outdated version that won't work with the current specs file.

#### MkDocs 
MkDocs is a static page generator specifically designed for documentation using Markdown.

The project documentation is written and hosted in the [Ardublockly repository GitHub Wiki][7]. The build script for the documentation pulls its markdown files and converts them into an HTML static site for offline access.

More information about this procedure can be found in [this article][8].

MkDocs can be easily installed using pip:

```
pip install MkDocs
```


## Build steps
Download and initialise this project repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly.git
cd ardublockly
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you have already downloaded the Ardublockly source code, make sure the submodules are initialise, in this case the 'closure-library' in the project root directory and 'pyinstaller' in the package folder. You can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the project root to ensure this is the case, otherwise the submodule directories will be empty.

First build the offline documentation by running the `build_docs.py` script from within the package folder. This will add a folder named `documentation` into the project root directory:

```
cd package
python build_docs.py
```

The build steps for Ardublockly are slightly different depending on the platform.


### Windows Build
To build Ardublockly under Windows all you have to do is execute the `build_windows.py` file from the project root directory:

```
python package\build_windows.py
```

This will remove any previous build directory, rebuild, and create the `ardublockly_run.bat` file into the project root.

To run Ardublockly on Windows execute the `ardublockly_run.bat` file.


### Linux Build
To build Ardublockly under Linux all you have to do is execute the `build_linux.py` file from the project root directory:

```
python package/build_linux.py
```

This will remove any previous build directory, rebuild, and create the `ardublockly_run.sh` file into the project root.

To run Ardublockly on Linux execute the `ardublockly_run.sh` bash file. Don't forget set the file as executable to be able to run it from your desktop environment.


### Mac OS X Build
This part of the documentation is still under work.


## Packing Ardublockly
Once the project is build there are a few unnecessary files that can be removed to save space.

You can pack ardublockly running the following command from the project root directory:

```
python package/pack_ardublockly.py
```

The pack script was designed for the build servers to zip the required contents into a single file to be uploaded to cloud storage, so it still leaves quite a few things behind. This script creates a new folder on the same level a the project root, and then zips it and saves it into the folder 'upload' within the project root.

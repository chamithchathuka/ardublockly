## Ardublockly
"Ardublockly" is a fork of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), a web-based graphical programming editor, that has been updated to work with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) code.

This project is influeced by BlocklyDuino, also based on an older version of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).

The "ArduBlocklyServerCompiler" component initialises a local server with Python to be able to compile and load the Arduino code using the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software).

## Ardublockly
"Ardublockly" is a fork of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), a web-based graphical programming editor, that has been updated to generate [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) code.

This project is influeced by BlocklyDuino, also based on an older version of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).

The "ArduBlocklyServerCompiler" component initialises a local server with Python to be able to compile and load the Arduino code using the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software).

### Features

Ardublockly is still under development and a lot of the main features are not yet implemented.

### Demo

A demo of the current state of Ardublockly can be found in the following two links:
* [Ardublockly](http://carlosperate.github.io/ardublockly/ardublockly/apps/arduino/index.html)
* [Ardublockly with material design](http://carlosperate.github.io/ardublockly/ardublockly/apps/arduino_material/index.html)

To load the code into an Arduino requires Ardublockly to be executed locally.
